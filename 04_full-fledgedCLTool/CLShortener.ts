/* Yeah so this version of the tool is invokable 
   from the command line, without needing to hard 
   change the path and line-lengths in the
    02_dist/Line_Shortener.js version, 
    though that way works as well
    
    I think this way is a true 
    command line tool though, since it's 
    fully callable from the command line, passing 
    in the path and line length args right in the 
    terminal
